	of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies
	and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies,
	wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication
	protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed
	intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one
	can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the
	Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities
	conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications,
	informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario,
	this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex
	discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of
	this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies
	reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced
	by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed

  abstract = {Radiation-induced soft error is a significant reliability issue in
	nanoscale technology nodes. As the sequential registers are major
	contributors to the system soft error rate, accurate analysis of
	their vulnerabilities at early design phases is essential for cost-efficient
	error mitigation. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to
	quantify the soft error vulnerabilities of the registers in control
	paths at Register-Transfer Level (RTL). By modeling the control path
	as a state transition system, formal probabilistic model checking
	is adopted to compute the register vulnerabilities by taking the
	workload dependency into consideration. Efficient RTL abstraction
	and model simplification techniques are proposed to achieve an exponential
	reduction of the state space, enabling our methodology to analyze
	large control modules in a typical embedded processor. The experimental
	results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, which
	can successfully quantify the non-uniform register vulnerabilities
	in RTL designs.},

	tools based on an explicit states enumeration. In this context, techniques
	allowing an efficient representation of the states are precious.
	We present in this paper a novel approach which enables to store
	the state space in a compact way. Though it belongs to the family
	of explicit storage methods, we qualify it as semi-explicit since
	all states are not explicitly represented in the state space. Our
	experiments report a memory reduction ratio up to 95% with only a
	tripling of the computing time in the worst case.},

	in the clock network. Due to design reuse, it is common to find designs
	that have already some partial clock gating. We propose to exploit
	the existing clock gating in order to extract stronger gating conditions
	for blocks that are poorly gated or not gated at all. A second contribution
	of our paper is a robust and scalable approach to extract stability
	conditions for clock gating. Finally, we present a uniform treatment
	of unobservability and stability as dual approaches for propagating
	gating conditions forward and backward. Experimental results demonstrate
	significant power reduction (in the range of 14% - 55% of the clock
	power) on Intel micro-processor designs.},

	having multiple read and write ports. More importantly, we augment
	such EMM to providing correctness proofs, in addition to finding
	real bugs as before. The novelties of our verification approach are
	in a) combining EMM with proof-based abstraction that preserves the
	correctness of a property up to a certain analysis depth of {SAT}-based
	BMC, and b) modeling arbitrary initial memory state precisely and
	thereby, providing inductive proofs using {SAT}-based BMC for embedded
	memory systems. Similar to the previous approach, we construct a
	verification model by eliminating memory arrays, but retaining the
	memory interface signals with their control logic and adding constraints
	on those signals at every analysis depth to preserve the data forwarding
	semantics. The size of these EMM constraints depends quadratically
	on the number of memory accesses and the number of read and write
	ports; and linearly on the address and data widths and the number
	of memories. We show the effectiveness of our approach on several

  abstract = {Abstract. We describe a viable approach for memory abstraction that
	preserves memory semantics, thereby augmenting the capability of
	{SAT}-based {BMC} to handle designs with large embedded memory without
	explicitly modeling each memory bit. Our method does not require
	examining the design or changing the {SAT} solver and is guaranteed
	not to generate false negatives. The proposed method is similar,
	but with key enhancements, to the previous abstract interpretation
	of memory that captures its forwarding semantics, i.e., a data read
	from a memory location is same as the most recent data written at
	the same location. In our method, we construct an abstract model
	for BMC by eliminating memory arrays, but retaining the memory interface
	signals and adding constraints on those signals at every analysis
	depth to preserve the memory semantics. The size of these memory-modeling
	constraints depends quadratically on the number of memory accesses
	and linearly on the bus widths of memory interface signals. Since
	the analysis depth of BMC bounds the number of memory accesses, these
	constraints are significantly smaller than the explicit memory model.
	The novelty of our memory-modeling constraints is that they capture
	the exclusivity of a read and write pair explicitly, i.e., when a
	{SAT} solver decides on a valid read and write pair, other pairs
	are implied invalid immediately, thereby reducing the solve time.
	We have implemented these techniques in our {SAT}-based BMC framework
	where we demonstrate the effectiveness of such an abstraction on
	a number of hardware and software designs with large embedded memories.
	We show at least an order of magnitude improvement (both in time
	and space) using our method over explicit modeling of each memory
	bit. We also show that our method of adding constraints boosts the
	performance of the SAT solver (in BMC) significantly as opposed to
	the conventional way of modeling these constraints as nested if-then-else
	expressions.},

	technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers
	the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators,
	from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments.
	The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network
	creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators
	blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information
	is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating
	picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling
	wireless technologies such as \{RFID\} tags and embedded sensor and
	actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the
	next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a
	fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages
	web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing
	web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries
	increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision
	for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling
	technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT
	research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation
	using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public
	Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the
	need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing
	directed at technological research community. },

	for the verification of native c++-programs. To allow platform independent
	model checking of the object code for concurrent programs, we have
	extended an existing virtual machine for c++ to include multi-threading
	and different exploration algorithms on a dynamic state description.
	The error reporting capabilities and the lengths of counter-examples
	are improved by using heuristic estimator functions and state space
	compaction techniques that additionally reduce the exploration efforts.
	The evaluation of four scalable simple example problems shows that
	our system StEAM1 can successfully enhance the detection of deadlocks

  abstract = {Schedulability analysis of real-time embedded systems requires worst
	case timing guarantees of embedded software performance. This involves
	not only language level program analysis, but also modeling the effects
	of complex micro-architectural features in modern processors. Speculative
	execution and caching are very common in current processors. Hence
	one needs to model the effects of these features on the Worst Case
	Execution (WCET) of a program. Even though the individual effects
	of these features have been studied recently, their combined effects
	have not been investigated. We do so in this paper. This is a non-trivial
	task because speculative execution can indirectly affect cache performance
	(e.g., speculatively executed blocks can cause additional cache misses).
	Our technique starts from the control flow graph of the embedded
	program, and uses integer linear programming to estimate the program's
	WCET. The accuracy of our modeling is illustrated by tight estimates
	obtained on realistic benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We present an asynchronous concurrency model based on networks
	of labeled automata, and we show how object code can be represented
	using this model. A verification tool based on the model is implemented
	using the GNU debugger to provide operational semantics of binary
	executable files. The mapping of object code to networks of labeled
	automata includes a notion of processor time represented as a discrete
	counter. Real-time concurrency errors are preserved in this model
	because discrete time semantics exactly match the host processor?s
	perspective of the world. We mitigate the complexity in state generation
	for the concurrency model by selectively storing states and memory
	contents. We show that these selective storage reduction techniques
	preserve a live variable bisimulation between the complete and reduced
	transition systems. Verification results are given for several simple
	programs and are validated on actual hardware.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Embedded software verification is an important verification
	problem that requires the ability to reason about the timed semantics
	of concurrent behaviors at a low level of atomicity. The level of
	atomicity is the smallest execution block (such as a machine instruction
	or a C instruction) that cannot be split by an interrupt. Combining
	a cycleaccurate debugger with model checking algorithms provides
	an accurate model of software execution at the machine-code level
	while supporting concurrency and allowing abstractions to manage
	state explosion. We report on the design and implementation of such
	a model checker using the GNU debugger (gdb) with different processor
	backends. A significant feature of the resulting tool is that we
	can adjust the level of atomicity during the model checking run to
	reduce state explosion while focusing on behaviors that are likely
	to generate an error.},
  comment = {In the introduction section, the paper explain why the executable
	code level should be considered but not the C-code level. (C-instructions
	are not automic, the can be interrupted by an interrupt routine,
	which leads to bugs because of interleave events).},

	that are not exploited by existing model checking algorithms. In
	this paper, we propose a novel disjunctive image computation algorithm
	and other simplifications based on these characteristics. Our algorithm
	divides an image computation into a disjunctive set of easier ones
	that can be performed in isolation. Hypergraph partitioning is used
	to minimize the number of live variables in each disjunctive component.
	We use the live variables to simplify transition relations and reachable
	state subsets. Our experiments on a set of real-world C programs
	show that the new algorithm achieves orders-of-magnitude performance
	improvement over the best known conjunctive image computation algorithm.},

	is observed that the commonly used synthesis-based gating still leaves
	a large amount of redundant clock pulses. Data-driven gating aims
	to disable these. To reduce the hardware overhead involved, flip-flops
	(FFs) are grouped so that they share a common clock enabling signal.
	The question of what is the group size maximizing the power savings
	is answered in a previous paper. Here we answer the question of which
	FFs should be placed in a group to maximize the power reduction.
	We propose a practical solution based on the toggling activity correlations
	of FFs and their physical position proximity constraints in the layout.
	Our data-driven clock gating is integrated into an Electronic Design
