New flow:
	The core expects instructions in hex.
	An example assembly file is found in /RISCV/Programs/fibonacci.s
	An example file with hex instructions is found in /RISCV/Programs/fibonacci.hex
	
	To generate fibonacci.hex from fibonacci.s : cd into /RISCV/Programs and do:
	$ python3 ../RISCV-RV32I-Assembler/src/rvi.py fibonacci.s --hex -o fibonacci.hex
	(can also be called as ./create_hex.sh).

Old flow:
	This code expects file.bin to be compiled riscv64 executable, steps to build it are:

	1)create dummy.S with following content:

	  .global _start
	  _start:
	  ADDI x5,x0,18
	  ADDI x6,x0,3
	  ADD x7,x6,x5

	2) riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -static -fpic -fvisibility=hidden -nostdlib -nostartfiles -std=gnu99 -O0 dummy.S
	3) riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary a.out file.bin

	Running ./assemble.sh combines 2) and 3)...
